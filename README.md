FOOTNOTES

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines [^2].

You can use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].
[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
    this allows you to have a footnot with multiple lines.
[^note]
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easeir identification and linking.
    This footnot also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
