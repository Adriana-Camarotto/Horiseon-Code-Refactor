# Horiseon Code Refactor

This is a code refactor for Horiseon webpage.
It was proposed from the Front End Web Development Bootcamp from edX.
This was an On-the-job ticket challenge and was provided me a starter code to refactor it (which means improve the code without changing what it does) to complete the challenge.

I really liked this challenge because it made me learn a lot about hosting service for software development and version control using Git and Github. I also had the oportunity to aply all the CSS and HTML concepts that were learned during the first week of bootcamp.

This is not a responsive webpage, so I am very exited to the next week on the bootcamp to learn and aply in the next projects responsive web desing.
